# Lyrics Generator

This project is a Lyrics Generator that uses gpt-2 as a base model and uses transfer learning and deep learning techniques to match the style or genre of an artist. This project aims to combine elements of machine learning, NLP, and music analysis to uncover patterns and insights within song lyrics. This could help in assisting or inspiring songwriters for music composition or poetry.
